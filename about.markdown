For my reflections on decision-making through the perspective of internal change, check out [Harmonic Decisions](https://harmonicdecisions.com). For my reflections on synthesizing my quest for spiritual absorption with the realities of day-to-day life, head over to [Two Feet In The Boat](https://twofeetintheboat.xyz).
